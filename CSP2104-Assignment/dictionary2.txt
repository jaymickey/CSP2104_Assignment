The capital A of the alphabets of Middle and Western Europe as also the small letter (a) besides the forms in Italic black letter etc. are all descended from the old Latin A which was borrowed from the Greek Alpha of the same form; and this was made from the first letter (�) of the Phoenician alphabet the equivalent of the Hebrew Aleph and itself from the Egyptian origin. The Aleph was a consonant letter with a guttural breath sound that was not an element of Greek articulation; and the Greeks took it to represent their vowel Alpha with the a sound the Phoenician alphabet having no vowel symbols;  The name of the sixth tone in the model major scale (that in C) or the first tone of the minor scale which is named after it the scale in A minor.

In a modern aeroplane the airfoils are called the wings and most of the lift is derived from these surfaces. In contrast to helicopters the wings are fixed to the passenger compartment (airframe) and do not move relative to the frame; thus such a machine is called a fixed-wing aircraft. These machines are called monoplanes biplanes triplanes or quadruplanes according to the number of main supporting planes (wings) used in their construction. After 1940 few planes with more than one airfoil were constructed and these are used by hobbyists or for special purposes. Being heavier than air they depend for their levitation on motion imparted by the thrust from either propellers driven by an engine or in a jet plane by the reaction from a high-velocity stream of gases expelled rearward from a jet engine. They start from the ground by a run on small wheels or runners and are guided by a steering apparatus consisting of horizontal and vertical movable planes which usually form part of the wings or tail. There are many varieties of form and construction which in some cases are known by the names of their inventors. In U.S. an aeroplane is usually called an airplane or plane.

Etymologically v is most nearly related to u w f b p; as in vine wine; avoirdupois habit have; safe save; trover troubadour trope. See U F etc;  As a numeral V stands for five in English and Latin.
